    <h2 align="center"><strike>Paid Instructions</strike> FREE Recreated Models.</h2>
        <p align="center">R€bri¢kabl£ is designed to provide free access to MOCs that are typically paid for on Rebrickable. By offering recreations of these paid models, the platform aims to democratize access to high-quality LEGO designs and make them available to everyone without cost.
        <br><br>
        The primary objective is to make LEGO building instructions widely accessible, removing financial barriers for enthusiasts who want to explore and build complex models. The focus is on expanding access to creative resources, regardless of their commercial status.
        <br><br>
        R€bri¢kabl£ seeks to support the LEGO and Rebrickable community by providing free resources that encourage creativity and exploration. This approach is driven by the belief that knowledge and design should be open to all, rather than restricted by financial considerations.
        <br><br>
        The platform challenges the traditional model of paid MOCs by offering them for free, aiming to disrupt the current market and promote a new standard where access to creative resources is not limited by cost.
        <br><br>
        From a broader perspective, the platform operates on the principle of open access to information and resources.<br>
